# R-clustering-find-optimum-clusters
The repo contains the code written in R to determine the optimum number of clusters for a dataset using algorithms like Elbow, Silhouette. The code is very well commented too in order to provide explanation and guidance while determining the number of clusters.

Here, 

To determine the optimal number of clusters there are more than 30 different types of methods available based on the different use cases. Among all the methods the most frequently used ones are Elbow method, Silhouette method, Gap-statistic method.

Elbow method is sometimes ambiguous because of the bent in the elbow curve not distinguishable easily so Silhouette method comes in handy to determine the number of clusters
